## by (Muyideen Khalifa)


## Dataset
>The dataset belongs to a credit facilitating company called Prosper and it contains loan and information regarding each loan, including loan amount, borrower rate (or interest rate), current loan status, borrower income, and many others.


## Summary of Findings

>  In the exploration, I discovered that the APR reduces with the increase of the original loan amount. The APR also reduces with an increase in Prosper rating. Prosper rating strongly affects the amount of loan a borrower have access to and the APR this may be because the borrower with a better rating has access to a large amounnt of loan.

> The employed status is the employment status with the largest borrower. The lower employment status duration has the highest count of loan listing. This implies that borrowers that has less than a hundred days are listed more on the loan data. 

> Income rate affects the amount of loan a borrower has access to. Borrowers with low income have access to lesser amount of loan when compared with borrowers with high income.

> Borroweres with better ratings have a larger monthly icome and loan amount.
